How sweet the sound\nThat saved a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found;\nWas blind, but now I see.\n\n[Verse 2]\n'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\nAnd grace my fears relieved;\nHow precious did that grace appear\nThe hour I first believed.\n\n[Verse 3]\nThrough many dangers, toils, and snares,\nI have already come;\n'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\nAnd grace will lead me home."
